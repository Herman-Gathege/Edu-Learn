Project Overview
EduLearn is a full-stack web application that integrates a Flask backend with a React frontend. It uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage and SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object Relational Mapping). The platform includes functionalities for user authentication, course management, and interaction with content. Users can sign up, log in, browse courses, and track progress.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Bootstrap
Backend: Flask, Flask-RESTful, SQLAlchemy, Bcrypt
Database: PostgreSQL
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and session management
Testing: Postman for API testing

Setup & Installation
To run the EduLearn project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Node.js and npm
PostgreSQL (or use a local database of your choice)
Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/edu-learn.git
cd edu-learn/backend
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your database:

Create a PostgreSQL database or modify config.py to use SQLite for development.
Run migrations to create tables:
bash
Copy code
flask db init      # Initializes the migration repository
flask db migrate   # Creates migration scripts
flask db upgrade   # Applies the migrations to the database
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Your backend should be running on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Your frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Running the Application
Make sure both the frontend and backend servers are running.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the EduLearn application.
Commands
Here are some useful commands for development:

Backend
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Initialize the database migrations:

bash
Copy code
flask db init
Generate migration scripts:

bash
